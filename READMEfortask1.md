Task1
Step 1: Import Libraries
        First, we need to import the necessary libraries.
        
Step 2: Load and Prepare the Data
        For demonstration purposes, let's assume we have a dataset in a CSV file.
        
Step 3: Data Preprocessing
        We need to handle any missing values and split the data into features and target variable.
        
Step 4: Split the Data
        We'll split the data into training and testing sets.
        
Step 5: Train the Linear Regression Model
        We'll create an instance of the LinearRegression model and fit it to our training data.
        
Step 6: Make Predictions
        We'll use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.
        
Step 7: Evaluate the Model
        We'll evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the coefficient of determination (RÂ² score).
        
Step 8: Visualize the Results
        Finally, we can visualize the results to understand how well the model is performing.
